# Comparing-Traditional-ML-Algorithms-for-Stock-Market-Prediction

I have compared tradtional Machine Learning Algorithms for checking their accuracy in predicting Stock Markets.The Algorithms used are as 
follows-
1). Linear Regression
2). Support Vector Machine
3). Random Forest Regressor

All the algorithms are not able to predict the prices. In fact they are not even close to predicting the prices. But they are able to determine
the trend that is whether the prices will go up or down.

The project contains the final report and if you are interested you can have a look at it.
